# Partial Implementation Plan on SQL

## 1. Scope

This plan applies a subset of the Deep Coding methodology to **SQL schema structures** (DDL) and **static query interfaces** (views, function signatures). It excludes stored procedure bodies and complex business logic due to lack of declarative interface contracts.

**In scope**:
- Table definitions, data types, constraints (CHECK, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY)
- Schema-level access control
- View definitions (as read-only interfaces)
- Migration scripts (as generated artifacts)

**Out of scope**:
- Stored procedure logic (imperative, no declarative spec)
- Triggers with custom business rules
- Dynamic query generation (application-level)

## 2. Core Principles (Technical Translation)

| Original Deep Coding Principle | SQL Technical Equivalent |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Intent–Structure–Implementation Separation | Desired schema (spec) → Current schema (state) → Migration script (implementation) |
| Generative Conformance | State-based migration tool (Atlas, Bytebase) generates SQL that conforms to declared schema |
| Recursive Refinement with Fixed Premises | Versioned migration scripts + schema snapshots as immutable checkpoints |
| Skeleton–Tissue Architecture | `skeleton` schema (base tables, constraints) + `tissue` schema (views, aggregations) |
| Inferential Information Density | Normalization level (redundancy) vs. query complexity (join count) trade-off |

## 3. Architecture Layers

```
Intent (human)
   ↓
Structural Specification (declarative)
   ├── skeleton/ schema (base tables, PKs, FKs, checks)
   ├── tissue/ schema (views, UDF signatures, no tables)
   └── specification file (HCL, YAML, or .sql schema dump)
   ↓
Generation Engine (state‑based migration tool)
   ↓
Validation Gate (static analysis + constraint enforcement)
   ↓
Fixed Premise Commit (migration script + schema snapshot)
```

### 3.1 Skeleton–Tissue Separation in SQL

**Skeleton schema** (manually maintained, low change frequency):
- Contains base tables, primary keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints.
- Stores cross-cutting concerns: audit columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`), soft-delete flags.
- Accessible to tissue schema but not vice versa.

**Tissue schema** (generated, replaceable):
- Contains views, materialized views, and user-defined function signatures.
- No base tables – reads only from skeleton schema.
- Can be dropped and regenerated from specification without data loss.

**Enforcing dependency direction** (PostgreSQL example):
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA skeleton;
CREATE SCHEMA tissue;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA skeleton TO tissue_role;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA tissue FROM skeleton_role;
```

## 4. Implementation Patterns

### 4.1 Specification as Declarative Schema Dump

Store a canonical representation of the desired schema in version control:

```sql
-- desired/schema.sql
CREATE TABLE skeleton.orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES skeleton.customers(id),
    amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL CHECK (amount >= 0),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending','paid','shipped'))
);
CREATE VIEW tissue.daily_sales AS
SELECT date_trunc('day', o.created_at) AS day, sum(o.amount) AS total
FROM skeleton.orders o GROUP BY day;
```

### 4.2 Generative Conformance via State-Based Tools

Use a tool (Atlas, Bytebase, or custom diff engine) that:

1. Reads the desired schema from specification files.
2. Compares it with the live database schema (via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or catalog).
3. Generates a migration script (ALTER statements) that transforms the live schema to match the desired state.
4. Validates that generated script does not violate constraints (dry-run).

**Workflow**:
```bash
atlas schema apply --url "postgres://..." --to file://desired/ --dry-run > migration.sql
# human reviews migration.sql (semi-automated)
atlas schema apply --url "postgres://..." --to file://desired/ --auto-approve
```

### 4.3 Validation Gates

| Gate | Tool/Method | Pass Condition |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Static syntax | `atlas schema validate` | No syntax errors |
| Constraint conformance | Live database `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK` enforcement | 0 constraint violations |
| Dependency direction | Custom script checking `tissue` → `skeleton` only | No inverse references |
| Snapshot consistency | `pg_dump --schema-only` vs. desired schema | No diff |

### 4.4 Fixed Premise Management

Each completed migration phase commits:

1. The **desired schema** files (single source of truth).
2. The **generated migration script** (for audit and rollback).
3. A **schema snapshot** (dump of the skeleton schema only, no data).

**Rollback**: Use `pgroll` or PlanetScale’s revert mechanism to restore previous snapshot. Accept that data written during the phase may be lost or require manual reconciliation.

## 5. Recursive Refinement Workflow

Each phase follows the **Expand/Contract** pattern (pgroll):

| Phase Step | Action | Deep Coding Equivalent |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Expand** | Add new columns/tables with NULL defaults; create new views. Do not drop or rename existing objects. | Extend specification while keeping old fixed premise intact. |
| **Dual period** | Both old and new schema versions coexist. Application reads/writes use version-aware views. | Old and new implementations run in parallel. |
| **Contract** | After all dependencies updated, drop old columns/tables/views. | Commit new fixed premise, retire old one. |

**Phase boundary commit message**:
```
Phase: add customer segmentation
Expand: added skeleton.customer_segments table, tissue.vip_orders view
Contract: dropped skeleton.legacy_customers.status column
Rollback: pgroll rollback --to version=before
```

## 6. Measuring Information Density for SQL

Use these proxies to evaluate schema quality (balancing redundancy vs. query complexity):

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Normalization level | 3NF for skeleton tables | Count of transitive dependencies |
| Average join count in tissue views | ≤ 4 | `EXPLAIN` + manual review |
| Constraint density | ≥ 1 CHECK or FK per table | Count constraints / tables |
| View nesting depth | ≤ 3 | Parse view definition |

High information density is achieved when the schema captures maximum invariants (constraints) with minimum cognitive cost (low join complexity).

## 7. Toolchain Requirements

- PostgreSQL 15+ (for `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` consistency and pgroll support)
- Atlas CLI (state-based migrations) or Bytebase
- pgroll (zero-downtime, reversible migrations)
- `sqlsurge` or `SlowQL` for static SQL validation (optional)
- Version control (Git) for desired schema files

For MySQL/others: Replace pgroll with PlanetScale’s online schema change tool or use Flyway with manual Expand/Contract.

## 8. Limitations and Trade-offs

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| No declarative interface for stored procedures | Keep procedures in application code; use SQL only for data layer. |
| Static validation cannot prove semantic correctness | Supplement with integration tests on a staging database. |
| Rollback may lose data | Apply “add-only” policy; never delete columns without deprecation period. |
| Vendor lock-in (pgroll only for PostgreSQL) | Abstract migration logic; treat PostgreSQL as target for skeleton layer. |

## 9. Conclusion

This partial implementation plan demonstrates that Deep Coding’s core mechanisms—structural separation, generative conformance, fixed premises, and recursive refinement—are **technically feasible for SQL schema management** when limited to DDL and static views. The resulting workflow:

- Replaces manual migration authoring with state-based generation.
- Enforces architectural boundaries via schema-level separation.
- Enables safe, reversible schema evolution through Expand/Contract phases.

The plan avoids philosophical framing and provides executable patterns using existing tools (Atlas, pgroll, Git). For teams already using declarative schema management, adopting this plan requires minimal additional tooling and yields higher consistency and lower maintenance overhead.
