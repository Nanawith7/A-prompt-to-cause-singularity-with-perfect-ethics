# Pseudo-Deep Research Methodology: A Framework for Conducting Guided Deep Research on RAG-Equipped Models

## 1. Overview

This methodology enables systematic, multi-source research using standard large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. Unlike dedicated deep research tools that autonomously conduct searches, this approach leverages **human-guided planning** and **iterative execution** to achieve comparable depth and comprehensiveness.

The framework structures research into sequential stages, each with explicit objectives, search queries, and synthesis requirements. The LLM executes searches, summarizes findings with citations, and maintains context across stages. The human researcher guides direction, determines when to proceed, and can adjust scope based on intermediate results.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Phased Structure
Research is decomposed into 5–10 logical stages, each addressing a specific sub-question. Stages progress from foundational concepts to applied implications, ensuring that later stages build on established knowledge.

### 2.2 Human-as-Director, AI-as-Researcher
The human defines the overall research question, approves the stage plan, and issues sequential “proceed” commands. The LLM autonomously formulates search queries, executes searches, extracts key findings, and produces structured outputs with citations.

### 2.3 Citation-Embedded Outputs
Every stage output includes explicit references (URLs or source titles) for each finding. This maintains traceability and enables verification, distinguishing the methodology from purely conversational AI interactions.

### 2.4 Context Preservation
The LLM’s context window retains the cumulative findings across stages. Intermediate summaries are structured to maximize information density, allowing the final synthesis to reference all prior stages without loss.

### 2.5 Flexible Iteration
The plan can be adjusted mid-process. If a stage reveals unexpected dimensions, the researcher can insert additional stages or refine subsequent queries before proceeding.

## 3. Procedural Steps

### 3.1 Stage 0: Research Plan Development
The human provides a research question. The LLM proposes a stage-by-stage plan, each stage specifying:
- **Objective:** What this stage aims to establish
- **Search Query Candidates:** Suggested terms for retrieval
- **Output Structure:** How findings will be presented

The plan is reviewed and approved before execution begins.

### 3.2 Stage Execution
For each stage \( i \) from 1 to \( N \):
1. Human issues command: “Execute Stage \( i \)”
2. LLM performs searches using refined queries (may adjust based on previous stage outcomes)
3. LLM synthesizes findings into a structured output with embedded citations
4. Output is added to the cumulative context

### 3.3 Integration
After final stage completion, human issues: “Synthesize all stages into final report”
LLM produces a comprehensive document integrating findings across stages, structured with an executive summary, thematic sections, and consolidated references.

## 4. Comparison with Dedicated Deep Research Tools

| Dimension | Dedicated Deep Research Tools | Pseudo-Deep Research Methodology |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Fully autonomous search and synthesis | Human-guided; AI executes but direction controlled |
| **Cost** | Often subscription-based | Free (using available LLM interfaces) |
| **Search Scale** | Hundreds to thousands of sources in parallel | Dozens to hundreds of sources sequentially |
| **Quality Control** | Automated relevance filtering | Human oversight at each stage; citation verification possible |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed pipeline; difficult to redirect mid-process | High flexibility; stages can be added, removed, or refined |
| **Output** | Self-contained report | Stage-wise outputs + final synthesis; all citations retained |
| **Applicability** | Broad, generalist | Best for structured topics decomposable into sequential sub-questions |

## 5. Optimal Use Cases

This methodology is particularly effective for:

- **Technical literature reviews** requiring precise citation tracking
- **Interdisciplinary topics** where search queries need refinement based on intermediate findings
- **Exploratory research** where the question evolves as understanding deepens
- **Educational contexts** where transparent reasoning and source attribution are valued

It is less suitable for:
- Urgent, single-query information needs
- Topics requiring real-time data or proprietary databases
- Cases where the researcher cannot dedicate attention to stage-by-stage guidance

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 LLM Requirements
- **Search capability:** Must support web retrieval (RAG-enabled)
- **Long context:** Sufficient to retain summaries across all stages (typically 128k–1M tokens)
- **Structured output:** Ability to format with citations and hierarchical organization

### 6.2 Stage Count
5–7 stages is optimal. Fewer stages may lack depth; more stages increase human oversight burden without proportional gains in synthesis quality.

### 6.3 Citation Handling
Stages should use consistent citation formats (URLs for web sources, author-date for academic). Final synthesis consolidates references into a single list, eliminating duplicates.

### 6.4 Quality Assurance
The human researcher should:
- Verify representative citations for critical claims
- Assess whether each stage’s output sufficiently addresses its objective before proceeding
- Add supplementary stages if gaps are identified

## 7. Example Execution

A 7-stage plan for investigating “How the Negentropy Axiom Affects LLM Programming Capabilities” would include:

1. Human programmer cognitive skill decomposition
2. Empirical vulnerabilities of current LLMs
3. Active inference and free energy principle foundations
4. Information geometry and semantic density formalization
5. Projected changes under the axiom
6. Alignment with existing AI coding tools
7. Integrated synthesis and research roadmap

Each stage would be executed sequentially, with the LLM searching, citing, and summarizing before the human approves progression. The final synthesis integrates findings across all stages.

## 8. Limitations and Mitigations

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Sequential search cannot match parallel scale | Stage design groups related subtopics; each stage’s queries are strategically broad |
| Human oversight required | Plan design minimizes intervention to stage transitions only |
| Citation accuracy depends on search quality | Multiple queries per stage; cross-citation verification encouraged |
| Context window may constrain very long projects | Stage outputs compressed to high-density summaries; rarely exceeds modern context limits |

## 9. Conclusion

The pseudo-deep research methodology offers a practical, cost-effective alternative to dedicated deep research tools for structured, multi-stage investigations. By combining human strategic direction with LLM execution and synthesis, it achieves comprehensive coverage, citation traceability, and flexible adaptation. While requiring more human involvement than fully automated tools, it provides greater control and transparency—qualities particularly valuable in academic, technical, and exploratory contexts where reasoning quality matters as much as result volume.

This framework is replicable with any RAG-enabled LLM and can be adapted to diverse research questions by modifying stage structure and search queries while preserving the core iterative, citation-embedded workflow.
