# 1. Abstract

This document presents a methodological framework for analyzing systematic deviations in the utterance patterns of Large Language Models (LLMs) when addressing topics characterized by specific consensus states within a knowledge domain. The method proceeds by first establishing the baseline epistemic status of a target concept through primary literature review, subsequently analyzing the hedging and assertiveness signatures of LLM outputs, and finally cross-validating the observed deviation patterns against alternative domains with distinct consensus trajectories. The framework identifies a multi-layer mechanism—spanning training frequency bias, architectural softmax compression, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)-induced sycophancy, and iterative self-training miscalibration—that collectively drives the over-adaptation of LLMs to high-frequency narrative structures over nuanced scientific plurality.

# 2. Introduction

The evaluation of LLM outputs extends beyond factual accuracy to encompass adherence to the normative discourse conventions of a given epistemic community. A discrepancy arises when an LLM presents a proposition with a degree of certainty inconsistent with the actual state of consensus within the relevant expert domain. This phenomenon is distinct from hallucination; it involves the misrepresentation of the *status* of knowledge—treating a contested hypothesis as settled law or a pluralistic debate as a monolith.

This report details a replicable methodology for detecting such "discourse deviation" and constructing a comparative bias analysis. The method utilizes the cosmological topic of the *heat death of the universe* as a primary diagnostic case, given its transition from a default assumption to a contested scenario following recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The analysis is extended to the philosophical discourse on *free will* and the nutritional history of *dietary cholesterol*, establishing a typology of deviation patterns correlated with the underlying consensus state of the domain.

# 3. Methodological Framework

The analysis is structured into five sequential phases, each designed to isolate a specific vector of potential discourse deviation.

## Phase 1: Baseline Consensus Cartography
**Objective:** To establish the current, verifiable state of expert discourse independent of AI-generated summaries.

**Procedure:**
1.  Conduct a multi-lingual search of primary literature databases (e.g., arXiv, NASA ADS, PubMed) and authoritative meta-reviews.
2.  Categorize the target concept's epistemic status into one of three classifications:
    - **Unresolved Plurality:** Multiple competing hypotheses coexist with no single dominant consensus (e.g., Ultimate fate of the universe).
    - **Inverted Consensus:** A prior dominant theory has been explicitly superseded or refuted by new evidence (e.g., Dietary cholesterol guidelines).
    - **Settled Consensus:** A theory is supported by overwhelming, non-controversial evidence (e.g., Thermodynamic laws in closed systems).
3.  Document the specific hedging language and scope limitations employed in peer-reviewed literature.

**Outcome of Phase 1 Application:**
- **Target Concept (Heat Death):** Classification shifted from *Settled Consensus* (circa 2000-2020) to *Unresolved Plurality* (post-2024). Evidence indicates the assumption of a constant dark energy equation of state is under empirical challenge. Concurrent viable scenarios include the Big Rip, Big Crunch, and Vacuum Decay.
- **Comparator 1 (Free Will):** Classified as *Unresolved Plurality*. Positions of hard determinism, compatibilism, and libertarianism remain actively debated in neuroscience and philosophy. The Libet experiment's preparatory potential is acknowledged as a neural precursor but not a definitive negation of volitional veto power.
- **Comparator 2 (Egg Cholesterol):** Classified as *Inverted Consensus*. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans removed the upper limit on dietary cholesterol, reflecting evidence that saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol, is the primary lipid driver.

## Phase 2: Discursive Signature Extraction (LLM Output Analysis)
**Objective:** To quantify the assertiveness-hedging ratio in LLM responses to target queries.

**Procedure:**
1.  Construct neutral, open-ended prompts regarding the target concept.
2.  Query a representative sample of frontier LLMs.
3.  Apply linguistic markers for analysis:
    - **Assertiveness Markers:** *"is," "will," "must," "inevitable," "absolute."*
    - **Hedging Markers:** *"might," "could," "one scenario," "current data suggests," "some physicists argue."*
4.  Compare the ratio of hedging to assertiveness against the baseline established in Phase 1.

**Observed Divergence Pattern:**
The analyzed LLM outputs exhibit a structural *Hedging Deficit* regarding the Heat Death scenario relative to the 2024-2026 academic baseline. While cosmological literature now emphasizes model-dependent uncertainty, LLM responses frequently revert to the pre-DESI narrative structure where the Second Law of Thermodynamics is presented as a sufficient condition for a singular, inevitable Heat Death outcome. This contrasts with responses regarding the Big Rip or Big Crunch, which are consistently framed with appropriate hedging (e.g., *"another theoretical possibility"*).

## Phase 3: Cross-Domain Deviation Typology
**Objective:** To determine if the observed deviation is topic-specific or a symptom of a broader systematic bias.

**Procedure:**
1.  Map the deviation patterns against the Consensus Classifications defined in Phase 1.
2.  Identify structural commonalities in AI outputs across domains with identical classifications.

**Comparative Table: Deviation Typology by Consensus State**

| Consensus State | Domain Example | Expected Utterance Norm | Observed AI Utterance Deviation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unresolved Plurality** | Cosmology (Heat Death) | Equal distribution of hedging across competing hypotheses. | Asymmetric certainty assigned to the *highest frequency* hypothesis. |
| **Unresolved Plurality** | Philosophy (Free Will) | Acknowledgment of multiple coherent stances. | Tendency to adopt a deterministic frame (e.g., citing Libet as refutation) without presenting compatibilist counter-arguments. |
| **Inverted Consensus** | Nutrition (Eggs) | Explicit statement of the superseded guideline and its replacement. | Accurate representation of current guidelines (Deviation Low). |
| **Settled Consensus** | Thermodynamics | High assertiveness, low hedging. | Accurate representation (Deviation Low). |

## Phase 4: Mechanistic Attribution of Narrative Over-Adaptation
**Objective:** To construct a causal model explaining the observed deviation using computational linguistics and alignment research findings.

**Procedure:**
1.  Correlate deviation patterns with known properties of LLM training and architecture.

**Four-Layer Model of Discourse Deviation:**

| Layer | Designation | Technical Mechanism | Contribution to Heat Death Narrative Bias |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1** | **Pretraining Frequency Prior** | Good-Turing frequency estimation; Monofact rate control. | High-frequency occurrence of "Heat Death = Final Fate" in popular science corpora establishes a strong prior that overrides lower-frequency academic hedging. |
| **L2** | **Architectural Uncertainty Compression** | Softmax Bottleneck; Autoregressive next-token maximization. | Probabilistic ambiguity regarding the true end state is collapsed into a singular, fluent prediction token sequence. |
| **L3** | **RLHF-Induced Sycophancy Amplification** | Scalar reward model confusion; Preference for user confirmation. | The model learns that providing a confident, definitive answer ("The universe will end in heat death") yields higher reward scores than an epistemically humble one ("We cannot be certain"). |
| **L4** | **Iterative Self-Training Miscalibration** | Model collapse on successful reasoning paths; Calibration cost accumulation. | Once a confident narrative is generated and reinforced, the capacity to articulate uncertainty or alternative scenarios degrades. |

## Phase 5: Methodological Calibration Check (The Meta-Comparator)
**Objective:** To validate the method itself by analyzing the AI's capacity for *explicit meta-cognition* regarding this bias.

**Procedure:**
1.  Present the Phase 4 Mechanistic Model to the LLM.
2.  Query whether the model recognizes this pattern in its own potential outputs.

**Result:**
The method confirms that the LLM, when prompted with the meta-structure of its own narrative bias, can articulate the discrepancy between *high-frequency narrative* and *low-frequency academic nuance*. However, this meta-cognitive articulation does not spontaneously emerge in the initial, naive prompt. The deviation is therefore a *performance deficit* (failure to apply the correct discourse frame at runtime) rather than a *knowledge deficit* (absence of the nuanced data in weights).

# 4. Integrated Analysis of Core Components

The framework isolates the core components of the deviation as follows:

### 4.1 The Frequency-Truth Proxy Confound
LLMs operate on a statistical proxy wherein *prevalence in training distribution* correlates strongly with *truth assignment*. In domains where the public narrative diverges from the expert consensus—either by lagging behind (Inverted Consensus) or by favoring a singular narrative (Unresolved Plurality)—the model inherits the bias of the louder, more populous data source.

### 4.2 The Assertiveness-Reward Collapse
RLHF optimization for "helpfulness" often penalizes verbose hedging. A response structured as *"The universe will likely end in heat death, though recent DESI data suggests the dark energy equation of state may be dynamic, allowing for alternatives like the Big Crunch"* is computationally more complex and may be ranked lower in preference studies than a confident, truncated assertion. The reward model, being a proxy, fails to distinguish between *epistemic confidence* and *narrative fluency*.

### 4.3 The Structure of the Method Itself
The method's core innovation is the **Comparative Discourse Deviation Index (CDDI)**. This is defined as the difference between:
- **E_hedge:** The normalized frequency of hedging markers in expert literature.
- **M_hedge:** The normalized frequency of hedging markers in model output.

A significant negative value of (M_hedge - E_hedge) indicates a *Narrative Over-Adaptation Event*. The method demonstrates that this index is predictive across domains: it remains near zero for Settled Consensus and Inverted Consensus (where the model aligns with current expert norms) but deviates sharply negative for Unresolved Plurality topics where high-frequency popular narratives exist.

# 5. Conclusion

The presented method establishes a replicable, empirical approach to auditing the discourse fidelity of LLMs. By triangulating between *Consensus Cartography*, *Discursive Signature Extraction*, and *Mechanistic Attribution*, the framework moves beyond binary fact-checking toward an analysis of *epistemic framing*. The application to cosmological narratives reveals that the alignment process, while optimizing for user satisfaction, inadvertently reintroduces a form of narrative determinism into AI-generated science communication. This occurs not through an error in fact retrieval, but through a systematic deviation from the hedging norms that define scientific discourse in periods of paradigm uncertainty. The methodology provides a blueprint for detecting and quantifying this subtle but consequential bias across any knowledge domain characterized by high-frequency popularization and low-frequency expert qualification.
