# How do you evaluate the prompt

## 1. Evaluation as a Multi-Dimensional Problem

Prompt evaluation requires separating two distinct axes of instruction following:

- **Output format adherence** – The model conforms to specified syntactic and structural constraints (JSON, XML, step numbering).
- **Reasoning process adherence** – The model follows explicit step‑by‑step reasoning instructions.

Empirical findings show an inversion: output format adherence improves task‑solving performance (1–6% relative gains when format is decoupled from task content), while reasoning process adherence degrades instruction following accuracy (up to 75% of reasoning traces fail to follow constraints). The two axes are not opposing; they interact through the structural properties of the prompt.

## 2. Structural Properties That Enable Evaluation

A prompt’s evaluability depends on how it organizes instructions. Three structural properties correlate with successful measurement:

| Property | Definition | Evaluation test |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Step atomicity** | Each instruction performs one logical operation. | Can a single step be removed without breaking other steps? |
| **Causal traceability** | Output of each step is explicitly used in subsequent steps. | Does changing a step’s output change the final answer? |
| **Verification hooks** | Steps can be tested independently. | Can a step be truncated or counterfactually substituted? |

When these properties are present, a user can:
- Locate the first step where reasoning diverges from expected logic.
- Formulate a targeted correction to that step’s precondition.
- Observe whether the correction propagates to the final output.

## 3. Faithfulness Modes of Chain‑of‑Thought

Chain‑of‑thought (CoT) traces are not literal records of internal computation. Three operational modes exist, each requiring different evaluation criteria:

| Mode | Definition | Evaluation approach |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| **Genuine** | Steps are necessary; removing them changes output. | Truncation test: output changes when steps are removed. |
| **Scaffolding** | Steps provide structural support but are not causally required. | Output unchanged after removal, but generation fluency degrades. |
| **Decorative** | Steps are post‑hoc rationalizations; removal does not change output. | Output unchanged; removal has no effect on fluency. |

Evaluators must distinguish these modes. Decorative steps inflate perceived reasoning quality without contributing to correctness.

## 4. Task and Model Dependencies

Prompt evaluation is not task‑agnostic. Structured prompt reading yields measurable gains only in tasks requiring multi‑step logical transformation:

- Mathematics
- Symbolic reasoning
- Planning
- llm_code_generation
For pattern recognition, factual recall, or simple classification, evaluating prompt structure beyond basic format instructions provides no advantage over direct output evaluation.

Model architecture also modifies evaluation criteria:
- **Reasoning‑first models** (DeepSeek‑R1, o1) perform internal reasoning; explicit CoT adds little to output quality while increasing token cost.
- **Instruction‑following models** (standard instruction‑tuned LLMs) benefit from structured CoT but exhibit lazy reasoning under complex constraints.

## 5. Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics

A complete prompt evaluation uses multiple metrics:

| Metric | Measurement | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Output format accuracy** | Percentage of responses matching specified syntax. | High values indicate format adherence but do not guarantee semantic correctness. |
| **Semantic coherence** | Logical consistency of content independent of format. | Measured via counterfactual substitution or verification chains. |
| **Silent commitment failure rate** | Proportion of confident, fluent outputs that contain undetectable errors. | Requires separate verification channel; correlates with over‑trust in plausible explanations. |
| **Deep‑thinking token ratio (DTR)** | Proportion of tokens that cause large shifts in the model’s predictive distribution. | Higher DTR correlates with reasoning depth (r = 0.82 with accuracy). |
| **Overthinking / underthinking balance** | Ratio of redundant reasoning steps to missing necessary steps. | Optimal balance depends on task difficulty; uniform length constraints degrade performance. |

## 6. Practical Evaluation Procedure

To evaluate a prompt, execute the following steps:

1. **Separate format from task** – Run the prompt with and without output format constraints. If format constraints degrade task performance, the prompt needs decoupling (e.g., moving format specifications to a separate parser or post‑processing step).

2. **Test step necessity** – For each reasoning step in the prompt, remove it and compare outputs. Steps whose removal changes the final answer are genuine; steps whose removal does not are scaffolding or decorative.

3. **Measure token efficiency** – Compute the DTR for the model’s response. Low DTR with long output indicates decorative or lazy reasoning. Short output with high DTR indicates efficient reasoning.

4. **Check for silent commitment** – Use a verification chain (same task, no original CoT visible) on a subset of outputs. Compare results. Disagreements indicate silent commitment failures.

5. **Adapt to task complexity** – For simple tasks, remove all reasoning instructions. For complex tasks, use adaptive thinking budgets (allocate fewer tokens to easy sub‑steps, more to hard sub‑steps).

## 7. Summary of Evaluation Criteria

A well‑evaluated prompt meets these conditions:

- Output format instructions are separable from task instructions.
- Each reasoning step is atomic, traceable, and independently verifiable.
- The model’s CoT is examined for decorative steps; only genuine steps are trusted for error localization.
- Task domain matches the evaluation method (logical transformation tasks only).
- Multiple metrics (accuracy, DTR, silent commitment rate, overthinking balance) are reported, not a single score.
