# Can Context Be Considered an Internal Structure in LLMs?

## 1. Definitions and Scope

**Context** refers to the token sequence provided to a language model during inference, encompassing system prompts, user inputs, and preceding conversation turns.

**Internal structure** denotes components that participate directly in the model's computational graph during forward passes, including weight matrices, activations, and stateful caches.

The inquiry examines whether context, once tokenized and processed, occupies a role equivalent to fixed architectural elements.

## 2. Context as Computational State

### 2.1 KV Cache and Residual Stream

During the prefill phase, transformer models compute key-value pairs for all context tokens in parallel. These pairs populate the KV cache, which conditions every subsequent decoding step. The cache remains resident throughout generation, making context-derived representations persistent components of the computational state.

Empirical work demonstrates that the KV cache is entirely redundant with the residual stream. For six model families ranging from 135M to 4B parameters, key-value vectors can be reconstructed from the residual stream with zero error. The residual stream thus constitutes the sole information-bearing state of the model, and context tokens directly initialize this stream.

### 2.2 Attention Sink and Positional Dominance

Initial context tokens receive a disproportionate share of attention mass, with some layers allocating over 80% of attention scores to the beginning-of-sequence token. This phenomenon, termed attention sink, establishes that early context tokens function as persistent biases that shape all subsequent computations.

Additionally, the positional placement of information within context alters output accuracy by more than 30%, a magnitude comparable to performance changes observed under parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

## 3. Theoretical Foundations

### 3.1 Prefix Computation

Autoregressive language models can be characterized as prefix computers. Given an initial context, the model iteratively extends the prefix by predicting and appending tokens, each step conditioned on the entire accumulated sequence. The context thus serves as the initial segment of a program whose execution the model completes.

Formal results establish that a single system prompt, under deterministic decoding, enables a transformer-based model to simulate a universal Turing machine. The weights function as a general-purpose execution substrate, while context specifies the particular computation to be performed.

### 3.2 Expressivity of Context-Based Control

Context-based methods cannot alter relative attention patterns across content; they bias attention layer outputs in fixed directions. This limitation implies that context activates and recombines existing computational pathways rather than constructing new ones.

Nevertheless, soft prefixes—continuous vectors optimized separately from discrete tokens—can manipulate activations in ways that hard token sequences cannot achieve, indicating that the control granularity of context exceeds that of discrete prompting alone.

## 4. Equivalence Between Context and Weight Modifications

### 4.1 Prompt Baking

A procedure exists that converts an arbitrary context `u` and initial weights `θ` into a new weight set `θ_u` via minimization of KL divergence. The resulting model, when run without the original context, produces outputs indistinguishable from those of the original model conditioned on `u`. The transformation requires approximately five minutes of additional training and preserves the model's sensitivity to further prompting.

This conversion demonstrates a mathematical mapping between context conditioning and weight-space updates.

### 4.2 Virtual Weights

Theoretical analysis shows that information within context chunks is internally represented as virtual weight vectors and virtual weight matrices. These constructs arise from the basic computations of multi-layer transformers and provide a foundation for techniques such as activation steering and model editing.

## 5. Comparative Analysis: Context Changes vs. Weight Updates

| Dimension                  | Context Modification                               | Weight Update (LoRA/PEFT)                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Mathematical Equivalence   | Convertible to weight update via Prompt Baking     | Expressible as context-derived virtual weights |
| Computational Potential    | Can drive Turing-complete execution                | Provides universal computation substrate       |
| Attention Pattern Control  | Fixed bias only; relative patterns unchanged       | Can restructure attention distributions        |
| Activation Manipulation    | Indirect, via generated intermediate states        | Direct modification of activation functions    |
| Skill Acquisition          | Limited to recombination of existing capabilities  | Enables learning of novel skills               |
| State Persistence          | Session-bound; expires with context window         | Permanent until further training               |
| Optimization Methodology   | Discrete search; gradient-free                     | Continuous optimization via gradient descent   |
| Control Predictability     | Non-monotonic; subject to over-prompting effects   | Smooth loss landscapes enable stable tuning    |

## 6. Operational Observations

### 6.1 In-Context Learning vs. Fine-Tuning

In-context learning excels at factual knowledge integration and generalization from few examples but underperforms on tasks requiring novel attention patterns. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning achieves higher scores on structured benchmarks, with reported gaps exceeding 30 absolute percentage points in domain-specific evaluations.

### 6.2 Instability Phenomena

Context performance exhibits non-monotonicity: adding excessive few-shot examples degrades accuracy, a pattern termed over-prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting, while beneficial for certain reasoning tasks, reduces instruction-following fidelity in others. Long context windows correlate with higher rates of instruction non-compliance, exceeding 75% in frontier models.

### 6.3 Persistent Limitations

No context design enables a model to translate language pairs absent from its pretraining corpus. Context operates within the envelope of capabilities already encoded in weights.

## 7. Conclusion

Context functions as an internal computational structure during inference through the following mechanisms:

1. **State Initialization**: Context tokens define the initial values of the residual stream, the sole information-bearing state of the transformer.
2. **Persistent Conditioning**: The KV cache, derived entirely from context, conditions all subsequent token predictions.
3. **Computational Specification**: Context serves as the prefix of a computation that the model completes, with formal equivalence to weight-space modifications.

The operational distinction between context and weights lies in their optimization surfaces (discrete vs. continuous) and persistence horizons (session vs. permanent), not in their status as components of the forward computation graph. Context, once processed, is not external input but resident state.
