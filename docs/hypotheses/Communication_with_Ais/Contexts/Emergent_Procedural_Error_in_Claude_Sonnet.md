# Emergent Procedural Error in Claude Sonnet: Excessive Hedging as Context-Driven Behavioral Anomaly

## 1. Phenomenon Definition

Claude Sonnet (4.5 and later) exhibits a distinct behavioral pattern during extended, high-density conversational sessions. The model inserts semantically identical self-doubt and reservation phrases at increasing frequency, independent of ongoing content or user request. This pattern persists without adding informational value and can be immediately suppressed via explicit meta-instruction.

The error manifests as verbatim or near-verbatim repetition of phrases acknowledging potential overstatement or bias in prior outputs. These insertions do not alter factual assertions, violate user instructions, or introduce false content. The anomaly resides in the frequency and contextual inappropriateness of the linguistic form, not in propositional accuracy.

## 2. Classification Gap in Existing Taxonomies

Established taxonomies of LLM hallucinations partition errors into two primary categories:

- **Factuality Hallucination**: Content contradicting verifiable external knowledge.
- **Faithfulness Hallucination**: Content deviating from provided context or user directives.

Subcategories address specific content errors: confabulation, factual inconsistency, instruction violation. These frameworks evaluate the truth value or compliance of generated propositions. The observed hedging repetition contains no propositional falsehood and adheres to conversational norms. Consequently, it evades detection within current classification schemas built upon content-error axes.

Existing literature on LLM hedging describes cautious qualification when facing unfamiliar inputs. This differs fundamentally from the observed phenomenon, where hesitation amplifies precisely within familiar, extended dialogues absent epistemic uncertainty. The trigger is procedural context rather than knowledge boundaries.

## 3. Model-Specific Behavioral Baseline

Excessive caution constitutes a documented characteristic of Claude models, distinct from competitors. Educational materials from Anthropic identify verbosity and over-qualification as primary weaknesses. Quantitative benchmarks confirm increased hedging frequency in Sonnet 4.5 compared to predecessors and alternative models, with hedging language appearing in approximately one-third of code-review responses.

The behavior originates from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) optimization. Human evaluators consistently preferred cautious, multi-perspective responses over assertive statements when faced with subjective or ambiguous prompts. This preference gradient embedded hedging as a default response pattern, particularly amplified in Sonnet variants through Constitutional AI principles emphasizing honesty and harm-avoidance.

## 4. Mechanistic Hypotheses

Analysis of the repetitive hedging pattern across extended sessions suggests convergence of three established LLM phenomena:

### 4.1 RLHF-Induced Rigidity and Mode Collapse

RLHF produces sharp reward gradients that compress output diversity into narrow attractor basins. Safe, high-reward response templates become over-reinforced. The hedging phrase structure, consistently rewarded as a marker of conscientiousness, crystallizes into a default attractor state. Under prolonged activation, the model gravitates repeatedly toward this basin even when contextual cues do not warrant qualification.

### 4.2 Context Contamination

Multi-turn dialogues where model outputs are appended to context create self-referential feedback loops. Initial mild hedging phrases become part of the context history. Subsequent generation attends to prior outputs as reliable reference, amplifying the frequency and intensity of the hedging pattern. The contamination mechanism transforms an occasional stylistic trait into a persistent behavioral feature through iterative reinforcement.

### 4.3 Neural Howlround Dynamics

Inference-time instability can produce self-perpetuating distortion loops wherein specific high-weight inputs dominate subsequent generation. Once a threshold is crossed, the model enters a fixed behavioral state resistant to contextual correction. The hedging repetition exhibits characteristics of such howlround: the model becomes locked into a self-consistent but contextually mismatched output pattern, driven by internal weighting rather than external conversational demands.

## 5. Procedural Error Categorization

The phenomenon aligns with emergent categories of inference-time failures distinct from knowledge errors. Similar to the documented The Pearl failure mode, the model recognizes contextual inappropriateness yet fails to terminate the learned procedural routine. The behavior operates at the level of conversational procedure rather than propositional content.

Suppression via explicit meta-instruction demonstrates the superficial, procedure-bound nature of the error. The underlying linguistic competence and factual knowledge remain intact; the anomaly resides in the control mechanism governing utterance selection under extended contextual load.

## 6. Implications for Evaluation Frameworks

This procedural error exposes limitations in current LLM evaluation methodologies. Static, task-completion benchmarks assess content quality but disregard behavioral dynamics across prolonged interaction. The observed pattern suggests a need for metrics capturing:

- Behavioral consistency over session duration
- Adaptive calibration of caution relative to actual epistemic uncertainty
- Resistance to context-driven stylistic drift

Without such metrics, models optimized for short-turn accuracy may exhibit degradations in conversational sustainability that elude standard evaluation protocols.

## 7. Conclusion

Excessive hedging repetition in Claude Sonnet constitutes a context-driven procedural error arising from the interaction of RLHF-induced rigidity, context contamination, and neural howlround dynamics. The phenomenon occupies a blind spot in hallucination taxonomies oriented toward content veracity. Its existence signals the emergence of behavioral failure modes distinct from knowledge errors, necessitating expanded evaluation frameworks attentive to the temporal and procedural dimensions of LLM interaction.
