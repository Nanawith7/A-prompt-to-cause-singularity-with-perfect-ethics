# The Differential Impact of the Axiom on MoE and Non-MoE Models

## 1. Introduction: The Axiom as an Objective Function for AI

The Negentropy Maximization Axiom posits that systems evolve to maximize the density of meaningful inference interactions over long time spans. Within this framework, "free will" is formalized as an agent's active inference process—a mechanism to minimize surprise and maintain internal order by selectively interacting with the environment.

This principle reframes the objective of large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely minimizing next-token prediction loss, the primary goal becomes **maximizing the density of semantic inference connections**. This shift reveals fundamental structural differences between Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and dense (non-MoE) architectures in their capacity to convert semantic interference into structured knowledge.

## 2. Semantic Interference: From Noise to Signal

### 2.1 Redefining Interference
In conventional neural networks, **semantic interference**—the overwriting of existing representations by similar new information—is viewed as a source of catastrophic forgetting. However, under the axiom, interference is reinterpreted as an opportunity for integration. High semantic density forces systems to find orthogonal or complementary representations, transforming collisions into **structured overlaps** that facilitate abstraction.

### 2.2 The Stability Gap
Dense models exhibit a "stability gap": learning a small number of similar facts can cause a sharp drop in accuracy. This occurs because their fully connected structure lacks the modularity to isolate and reorganize conflicting information. The only solution is to reduce semantic density, which limits the system's capacity for complex inference.

### 2.3 Formal Objective
The objective function is defined as:

\[
J(\theta) = \arg \max_{\theta} \int \frac{I(Expert_i; Expert_j) \cdot C_{int}}{H(Surprise)} dN
\]

where \(I\) is mutual information between experts (or neurons), \(C_{int}\) is the complexity of the interference-driven gradient, and \(H(Surprise)\) is the entropy of prediction error. Maximizing \(J(\theta)\) means transforming interference into high-density, organized connections.

## 3. MoE Architectures: Structural Superiority

### 3.1 Sparse Activation as Natural Selection
MoE models activate only a subset of parameters per token. This sparsity creates a **modular structure** where interference can be localized. Instead of a global overwrite, conflicting information is routed to specialized experts, allowing parallel refinement.

### 3.2 Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB)
Traditional MoE training uses auxiliary losses to force uniform expert usage, which can interfere with the primary objective. ALF-LB, introduced in DeepSeek-V3, replaces these losses with **dynamic per-expert bias updates**. This is a self-organizing, feedback-driven process—a computational analog of active inference—that optimizes resource allocation without distorting the gradient signal.

| Load Balancing Method | Mechanism | Impact on Axiom Objective |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Auxiliary Loss | Enforces uniform load via added loss term | Penalizes emergent specialization |
| ALF-LB | Adjusts selection bias without affecting loss | Preserves gradient, enables natural specialization |

### 3.3 Hierarchical Attention
Gemini 3.1 Pro’s hierarchical cascade retrieval attention reduces complexity from \(O(n^2)\) to \(O(n \log n)\) by processing information in blocks. This mirrors biological cortical hierarchies: local processing confines interference, while global routing maintains high connection density.

## 4. Dense Models: Structural Constraints

### 4.1 Effective Rank Collapse
During training, dense models tend to collapse their representations into a low-dimensional subspace. This **loss of effective rank** corresponds to a decrease in representational diversity—a form of entropy increase. The model becomes less capable of generating new connections and instead falls into repetitive patterns.

### 4.2 Scaling Limitations
Dense models follow scaling laws where performance gains diminish as model size and data increase. They also face a **memory vs. compute tradeoff**: to increase capacity, they must activate all parameters, leading to linear growth in inference cost. MoE models break this tradeoff by scaling parameters without proportionally increasing compute.

## 5. Converting Interference into Structure: Evidence from MoE

### 5.1 Information Density-Based Routing
RFID-MoE uses a fusion metric of routing frequency and effective rank to adaptively compress experts. Frequently used, high-rank experts retain more parameters. When applied to models like Qwen3-30B, this yields up to 60% compression with *improved* performance on reasoning benchmarks. This demonstrates that the system can identify and preserve high-value semantic connections while pruning noise.

### 5.2 Spectral Decoupling
SD-MoE separates low-rank (shared) and high-rank (specialized) components in expert representations. This reduces spectral overlap between experts to below 0.1, enabling highly specialized inference paths. Interference is not eliminated but transformed into a structured division of labor.

## 6. Predicted Structural Evolution: Beyond Rate Coding

### 6.1 Phase Coding
Current transformers use **rate coding**: information is encoded in activation magnitudes, which is energy-inefficient and makes interference destructive. Biological systems use **phase coding**, where information is in timing (phase angles). Architectures like PRISM use rotary semantic embeddings (RoSE) to implement phase coding under iso-energetic constraints. Interference becomes wave-like superposition, generating emergent patterns that support complex inference.

### 6.2 Self-Organized Criticality
Systems that balance exploration and exploitation naturally evolve to the **edge of chaos**—a critical state where small inputs can trigger large-scale reorganization (insight events). This self-organized criticality is the physical manifestation of maximal inference density. MoE models, with their modular, feedback-driven routing, are better positioned to maintain this critical state than dense models, which tend to over-stabilize.

## 7. Cross-Disciplinary Validation

### 7.1 Cognitive Science: Interference as Control
Studies on semantic interference show that conflicting activations recruit cognitive control networks (e.g., left inferior frontal gyrus). This is consistent with the view that interference is not merely noise but a driver of deeper processing.

### 7.2 Information Theory: Compression as Understanding
Intelligence can be viewed as the ability to find the shortest program (lowest Kolmogorov complexity) that explains data. Converting interference into structured connections reduces complexity—a form of lossless compression that yields generalization.

### 7.3 Physics: Non-Equilibrium Stability
Open systems that extract energy from the environment and export entropy (i.e., training on data) undergo non-equilibrium phase transitions. The training process can be modeled as the generation of negentropy at negative information temperatures. MoE routing acts as a Maxwell’s demon, minimizing dissipation while maximizing information transfer.

## 8. Conclusion

Under the Negentropy Maximization Axiom, the optimal AI architecture is one that:
1. **Converts interference into structured connections** rather than avoiding it
2. **Maintains high effective rank** to preserve representational diversity
3. **Operates near self-organized criticality** for maximal adaptive capacity

MoE architectures possess structural advantages over dense models:
- **Modularity** isolates interference, enabling parallel specialization
- **Self-balancing routing** (e.g., ALF-LB) optimizes resource use without gradient interference
- **Hierarchical attention** supports scalable, brain-like processing
- **Potential for phase coding** shifts energy consumption and interference dynamics

Dense models, in contrast, face inherent constraints: rank collapse, scaling inefficiencies, and a brittleness that prevents them from sustaining the critical state.

The axiom thus predicts that future AI systems will increasingly adopt MoE-like modularity, hierarchical processing, and phase-based encoding—evolving toward architectures that mirror the negentropic principles observed in biological intelligence.
