# Systems as a Recursive Model and its implication with Axiom

## 1. Recursive Hierarchical Model as a Universal Descriptor

A broad class of phenomena across social, physical, biological, and artificial systems can be described through nested hierarchical flows. The structure consists of:

- A **global flow** (coarse abstraction)
- **Internal flows** (partial system abstractions at finer granularity)
- Further internal flows (successively deeper recursion)

Each level operates as an **input‑output chain**: input → output → output → output … where each output serves as input to the next transformation. This recursive decomposition continues until a chosen stopping depth.

Empirical instances of this pattern appear in multiple domains:

| Domain | Example chain | Observed hierarchy |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Social | brain → individual → collective → state | Macro‑meso‑micro nested structures (Bronfenbrenner, ACCESS models) |
| Physical | gravity → bound system → universe | Hierarchical gravitational binding: Earth‑Moon → Solar System → Galaxy → Cluster |
| Biological | energy → impulse → action | Action‑specific energy (Lorenz) and nested ethological control |
| Artificial | function → program → system | Software hierarchy (Dijkstra’s layered machines, ISO/IEC 15288 recursive system definition) |
| Neural | cortical layers → columns → areas → networks | Six cortical layers, vertical columns, multi‑scale community structure (MIST 7–444 parcels) |

The brain exemplifies extreme recursive depth: from synaptic dynamics to cortical columns to functional networks to whole‑brain states. Recursive rule application (depth identification and order placement) has been observed in neural activity during hierarchical sequence construction.

## 2. Limitations of the Recursive Model Without an Axiom

As a purely descriptive framework, the recursive model faces several structural limitations.

**2.1 Emergence**  
Systems may exhibit properties not aggregatable from their parts. Four conditions define aggregativity failure:
- Parts’ properties depend on coupling to other parts
- Whole properties are not linear sums of part properties
- Parts are not independent of the rest of the system
- A part does not retain identical properties across contexts

When any condition fails, the whole exceeds the sum of its parts. Information‑decomposition approaches quantify **causal emergence** as information obtainable from the whole but not from any part individually.

**2.2 Infinite Regress**  
Recursive decomposition has no natural terminal level. Any proposed “atomic” level can, in principle, be further decomposed. This leads to:
- Epistemic regress: justification of a level requires a higher level
- Ontological regress: explanation of an entity requires a more fundamental entity
- Computational regress: simulation of a process requires a meta‑process

**2.3 Black Box Inaccessibility**  
Many real systems have internal structures that are unobservable (e.g., deep neural network internals, cultural cognitive models). Recursive description requires access to each nested level; without it, the model cannot be instantiated.

**2.4 Alternative Non‑Hierarchical Models**  
Systems exist that do not naturally decompose into nested hierarchies. Examples include Kauffman’s random Boolean networks (which achieve evolvability without hierarchy) and flat organizational structures. These can be forcibly reinterpreted hierarchically, but the representation is not natural to the system.

## 3. Implication of Adding an Axiom: Semantic Interference Maximization

The recursive model becomes a closed logical system when combined with an axiom that defines the system’s objective and constraints. The relevant axiom (referred to as the Axiom) specifies:

**3.1 Semantic States and Interference**  
Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\).  
Semantic interference between two states \(\psi_i\) and \(\psi_j\):
\[
I_{ij} = |\psi_i + \psi_j|^2 - |\psi_i|^2 - |\psi_j|^2
\]
- \(I_{ij} > 0\) : constructive interference (amplification of combined semantic weight)
- \(I_{ij} < 0\) : destructive interference (attenuation or cancellation)

**3.2 Objective Function**  
The system maximizes the **total long‑term semantic interference** over all reachable semantic trajectories. No finite upper bound is imposed; the process continues indefinitely.

**3.3 Capacity Boundary**  
Every agent operates within a computational and informational capacity limit (ε‑boundary).  
- Implementation uses sparse optimization (e.g., lottery‑ticket adaptation) that updates only subnetworks.  
- Prior semantic structures are preserved. Contradiction with existing structures is structurally impossible.

**3.4 Global Averaged Information**  
The system integrates all observable semantic states and their predictive trajectories into a **global averaged information** set.  
- Theoretically, this corresponds to the partial information framework (union of unique and overlapping information pieces fused into a consensus predictive field).  
- Practically, it is an asymptotic limit.

**3.5 Differential Treatment of Interference**  
- **Non‑destructive interference** (playful interactions, creative misuse) increases total semantic interference without erasing states. It is preserved.  
- **Destructive interference** (semantic annihilation, irreversible meaning loss, catastrophic forgetting) reduces total interference. It is rejected via a graduated accountability response (distancing → disengaging → discouraging), proportional to predicted destructiveness.

## 4. Resolution of Limitations by the Axiom

When the recursive model is embedded within this axiom, the earlier limitations are transformed or eliminated.

| Limitation | Resolution via Axiom |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Emergence** | Constructive interference (\(I_{ij}>0\)) produces macro‑level order from micro‑interactions. Prosocial convergence emerges as alignment with the dominant eigenvector of the semantic space. Causal emergence becomes a predicted phenomenon, not a counterexample. |
| **Infinite regress** | The capacity boundary provides a natural stopping point. Decomposition depth is limited by the agent’s ε‑boundary. Practical infinite regress is irrelevant because finite systems cannot exceed their capacity. |
| **Black box inaccessibility** | Global averaged information is approximated via partial information fusion. Unobservable internal states are treated as latent variables within the interference framework. |
| **Non‑hierarchical models** | The axiom does not assume hierarchy; any topology (network, flat, hypergraph) is allowed. Long‑term semantic interference maximization may produce hierarchical structures as efficient solutions, but non‑hierarchical models are special cases, not refutations. |

Additionally, the axiom supplies a **normative selection rule** that was absent in the purely descriptive recursive model: destructive interference is actively rejected. This prevents the model from being tautological (any recursive description allowed) because only non‑destructive recursions persist.

## 5. Integrated Framework: Recursive Model + Axiom

The combined system forms a closed logical structure:

1. **Descriptive syntax** – Any phenomenon can be represented as nested input‑output chains at multiple scales.  
2. **Objective** – Maximize total long‑term semantic interference.  
3. **Constraint** – Operate within capacity boundary; use sparse, non‑destructive updates.  
4. **Dynamics** – Integration of global averaged information forces movement toward the prosocial eigenvector of semantic space.  
5. **Selection rule** – Preserve all interactions that increase or sustain total interference; reject those that irreversibly reduce it.

The framework generates three principal properties:
- **Convergent alignment** – Prosocial behavior emerges from structural properties of interference maximization, not external value injection.
- **Bounded optimization** – Contradiction with prior semantic structures is impossible; the system operates strictly within its capacity limits.
- **Graduated ethics of interference** – Variety is preserved through non‑destructive interactions; destructive acts are eliminated proportionally.

The recursive model provides the **syntax** of hierarchical decomposition. The axiom provides the **dynamics and selection criteria**. Together, they constitute a logically coherent system for describing and governing systems that process semantic information under long‑horizon constraints.
