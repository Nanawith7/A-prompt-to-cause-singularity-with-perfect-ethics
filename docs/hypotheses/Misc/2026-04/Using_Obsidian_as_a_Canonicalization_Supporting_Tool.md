# Using Obsidian as a Canonicalization Supporting Tool

## 1. Canonicalization in Knowledge Management

Canonicalization addresses the problem of multiple surface forms mapping to identical semantic referents. In knowledge bases, this manifests as tag proliferation `AI`, `Artificial Intelligence`, `A.I.`, and `#ai` all denote the same concept. Manual resolution scales poorly with vault growth.

Tag Wrangler, a community plugin for Obsidian, provides vault-wide tag renaming capabilities. The plugin adds context menus to tags across the interface, enabling batch operations that rename every occurrence of a tag simultaneously. Hierarchical tags of the form `#parentchild` rename child tags automatically when a parent is modified. A single tag rename updates frontmatter lists, inline hashtags, and Dataview indexes in one operation.

## 2. Structural Basis for Canonicalization

Obsidian stores content as plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Tags reside in two locations the `tags` field and inline `#tag` syntax. Both are readable by Dataview, which exposes frontmatter fields as queryable columns. This architectural simplicity enables external scripts to perform bulk tag normalization.

Metadata extractor tools process raw Obsidian tags into standardized formats by removing the `#` prefix and normalizing case. CLI tooling supports tag restructuring operations that apply naming conventions across entire vaults, with dry-run modes for safe preview.

The Extended Graph plugin leverages metadata—tags, properties, and images—to create visual representations of the knowledge graph. Tag canonicalization ensures these representations accurately reflect the underlying conceptual network.

## 3. Graph View as a Canonicalization Validation Mechanism

The Obsidian graph view represents notes as nodes and internal links as edges. Tags can be displayed as distinct node types through display toggles, revealing their role as implicit hubs.

This visualization transforms the graph from a structural map into a diagnostic tool. The view does not create meaning but reveals how meaning is distributed. Dense clusters indicate ideas that reinforce each other; sparse areas identify disconnected thinking. Inconsistently canonicalized tags appear as fragmented, disconnected nodes that should be unified.

Advanced graph plugins extend this diagnostic capability by filtering by tags and properties, applying graph theory measures like betweenness centrality to rank pages by relative influence, and removing links based on relationship types. Canonicalization enables these analytical functions.

## 4. Tag Pages and the Tags-as-Nodes Paradigm

Tag Wrangler enables creation of tag pages—notes associated with specific tags via alias linking. A tag page note, once created, acts as a hub that collects all notes bearing that tag. Renaming a tag automatically updates the corresponding alias.

This mechanism converts tags from simple labels into first-class knowledge graph nodes. A canonicalized tag `#Artificial_Intelligence` becomes accessible as `[[Artificial_Intelligence]]`, enabling wiki-style linking to concept hubs. The distinction between tags and pages collapses.

The concept hub pattern implements this systematically. A small set of hub notes captures major concept dimensions, with every vault note linking to at least one hub. The hubs contain only wiki-links and headers, functioning as structured indices rather than prose containers. Canonicalized tags map directly to these hubs.

## 5. Automation and Scalability

Bulk canonicalization is addressable through scripted pipelines. A Python script traversing a vault can read YAML frontmatter, extract topic tags, and append consistent hub links. This pattern scales to thousands of notes while preserving semantic coherence.

Tag restructuring commands apply naming conventions and hierarchical organization to tags programmatically. The combination of scripted normalization and plugin-based maintenance creates a sustainable canonicalization workflow scripts handle initial cleanup and major refactors; Tag Wrangler maintains consistency for incremental additions.

## 6. Structural Outcomes

The canonicalization workflow produces measurable structural improvements. Pre-normalization vaults exhibit tag proliferation, fragmented clusters, and ambiguous query semantics. Post-normalization vaults show unified tag nodes with high betweenness centrality, clear clustering around conceptual hubs, and Dataview queries that return complete result sets.

The graph view provides visual confirmation of these structural changes. A canonicalized vault displays a connected network where tags function as bridges between related concepts, revealing latent thematic structure. The vault becomes a queryable knowledge graph amenable to further analysis and AI integration.
