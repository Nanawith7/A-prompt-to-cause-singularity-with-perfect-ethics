# Architecture for Historical Knowledge Graph Visualization and Collaborative Research Infrastructure

## 1. Overview

A collaborative knowledge graph system designed for historical research enables the structured representation of primary sources, scholarly interpretations, and inferred causal relationships. The architecture integrates three distinct data layers within a graph database framework, supporting both expert collaboration and public resource accessibility. The system emphasizes provenance tracking, version control, and standards-based data modeling to ensure long-term sustainability and interoperability with established digital humanities infrastructures.

## 2. Data Model Architecture

### 2.1 Three-Layer Knowledge Representation

The system models historical knowledge using three interconnected layers, each with distinct ontological commitments and provenance requirements.

| Layer | Content Type | Primary Standard | Provenance Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Factual Layer** | Primary sources, artifact metadata, temporal-spatial coordinates, textual transcriptions | CIDOC CRM | Direct source citation |
| **Interpretive Layer** | Scholarly assertions, competing hypotheses, attribution claims, dating estimations | CIDOC CRM E13 Attribute Assignment | Nanopublication with PROV-O |
| **Causal Layer** | Inferred causal links, influence relationships, counterfactual absence markers, motivation hypotheses | Extension vocabulary | RDF-star qualified statements |

#### 2.1.1 Factual Layer Implementation

The factual layer employs CIDOC CRM as the core ontology for cultural heritage information. Primary source entities are represented as `E31 Document` or `E73 Information Object` instances, linked to physical artifacts (`E22 Human-Made Object`) via `P128 carries` relationships. Temporal information uses `E52 Time-Span` with `P82a begin of the begin` and `P82b end of the end` properties for precise interval representation.

#### 2.1.2 Interpretive Layer Implementation

Multiple competing interpretations are managed through CIDOC CRM `E13 Attribute Assignment` class, which explicitly permits "contradictory sets of values" for the same property. Each interpretation is modeled as:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Interpretation Assertion"
        A[E13 Attribute Assignment]
        B[E39 Actor: Scholar]
        C[E52 Time-Span: Assertion Date]
        D[E31 Document: Source Evidence]
        E[Interpreted Value]
    end
    A -->|P14 carried out by| B
    A -->|P4 has time-span| C
    A -->|P16 used specific object| D
    A -->|P141 assigned| E
```

This structure allows parallel coexistence of contradictory claims regarding dating, authorship attribution, or event interpretation.

#### 2.1.3 Causal Layer Implementation

Causal relationships and inferred motivations are represented using RDF-star to attach contextual metadata directly to triple statements. The model distinguishes:

- **Positive causality**: `<<:eventA :causes :eventB>> :assertedBy :scholarX ; :basedOn :sourceY`
- **Motivation hypotheses**: `<<:personA :authored :documentB>> :motivationHypothesis "financial support" ; :evidence :letterC`
- **Documented absence**: `:eventX :notReferencedIn :sourceZ` with explicit metadata indicating the significance of omission

Fuzzy temporal intervals for uncertain dates utilize the HuTime ontology pattern, storing `earliestPossible` and `latestPossible` bounds rather than precise dates.

### 2.2 Ontology Stack

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Core Ontologies"
        O1[CIDOC CRM v7.1.2<br>Cultural Heritage]
        O2[CRMinf<br>Argumentation Model]
        O3[PROV-O<br>Provenance]
        O4[CiTO<br>Citation Typing]
        O5[HuTime<br>Fuzzy Temporality]
    end

    subgraph "Extension Vocabularies"
        E1[Interpretation Relationships<br>supports / refutes / extends]
        E2[Causal Link Types<br>causes / influences / motivates]
        E3[Absence Markers<br>silenceRegarding / omittedFrom]
    end

    subgraph "Application Profile"
        AP[Historical Research Application Profile<br>SHACL Constraints]
    end

    O1 --> AP
    O2 --> AP
    O3 --> AP
    O4 --> AP
    O5 --> AP
    E1 --> AP
    E2 --> AP
    E3 --> AP
```

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Component Overview

The architecture follows a three-tier pattern with clear separation between storage, business logic, and presentation layers.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Client Tier"
        C1[Obsidian Desktop<br>Markdown Editor]
        C2[Web Visualization<br>LYNX / Cytoscape.js]
        C3[Admin Dashboard<br>GraphDB Workbench]
    end

    subgraph "API Gateway"
        G1[REST API]
        G2[SPARQL Endpoint]
        G3[WebSocket<br>Real-time Collaboration]
    end

    subgraph "Service Tier"
        S1[RDF Transformation<br>Markdown to RDF]
        S2[Version Control<br>Quit Store / TerminusDB]
        S3[Provenance Service<br>Nanopublication Generator]
        S4[Validation Service<br>SHACL / Ontology Constraints]
        S5[Sync Service<br>Obsidian ⇄ RDF]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Tier"
        D1[RDF Triple Store<br>GraphDB / RDF4J]
        D2[Git Repository<br>Version History]
        D3[Blob Storage<br>Binary Assets]
    end

    C1 --> G1
    C2 --> G2
    C3 --> G1
    G1 --> S1
    G2 --> D1
    G3 --> S2
    S1 --> D1
    S2 --> D2
    S3 --> D1
    S5 --> S1
```

### 3.2 Storage Selection: RDF Triple Store

| Criteria | RDF Triple Store (GraphDB) | Labeled Property Graph (Neo4j) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CIDOC CRM Compliance | Native support via ontology import | Requires neosemantics plugin |
| Inference Capabilities | Built-in RDFS/OWL reasoning | Application-layer implementation |
| Standard Query Language | SPARQL 1.1 | Cypher (proprietary) |
| Provenance Tracking | RDF-star / Named Graphs | Property-based workarounds |
| Semantic Web Interoperability | Direct Linked Data publishing | Export-dependent |
| Community Adoption in DH | Widespread (FactGrid, CHAD-KG) | Growing (Romans 1by1) |

The RDF triple store approach is selected due to native alignment with CIDOC CRM and the broader Semantic Web ecosystem.

### 3.3 Version Control: Git-Based RDF Management

Quit Store provides a SPARQL endpoint that persists all updates as Git commits within a repository. This enables:

- **Branching for competing interpretations**: Researchers maintain separate branches for alternative historiographical frameworks.
- **Commit-level provenance**: Each SPARQL UPDATE operation generates a signed commit with author metadata.
- **Merge workflows**: Divergent interpretation branches can be merged with conflict resolution protocols.
- **Time-travel queries**: Historical states of the knowledge graph are queryable via commit references.

Alternative implementations include TerminusDB for document-graph hybrid versioning and GraphWorld for agent-based collaborative editing environments.

### 3.4 Provenance Infrastructure

The provenance system combines two complementary standards:

| Component | Standard | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provenance Vocabulary** | W3C PROV-O | Describes entities, activities, and agents involved in assertion creation |
| **Assertion Packaging** | Nanopublication | Bundles assertion, provenance, and publication metadata into citable units |

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Nanopublication"
        NP1[Assertion Graph<br>Subject-Predicate-Object]
        NP2[Provenance Graph<br>Who-When-How]
        NP3[Publication Info<br>Identifier-Creator-Date]
    end
    NP1 -->|prov:wasAttributedTo| NP2
    NP1 -->|prov:wasDerivedFrom| NP3
```

Each scholarly interpretation exists as an independently citable nanopublication with a Trusty URI identifier.

### 3.5 Citation Typing with CiTO

The Citation Typing Ontology (CiTO) enables explicit characterization of citation intent:

| CiTO Property | Interpretation in Historical Context |
| :--- | :--- |
| `cito:supports` | One interpretation corroborates another |
| `cito:refutes` | One interpretation contradicts another |
| `cito:extends` | One interpretation builds upon and expands another |
| `cito:usesDataFrom` | Interpretation derived from specified primary source |
| `cito:citesAsAuthority` | Reference to established scholarly consensus |

### 3.6 Obsidian Integration Strategy

Obsidian serves as the primary authoring environment for researchers. The integration employs a hybrid synchronization model:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Researcher (Obsidian)
    participant O as Obsidian Plugin
    participant A as API Gateway
    participant T as RDF Transformer
    participant S as Triple Store

    R->>O: Save Markdown Note
    O->>A: POST /notes with YAML frontmatter
    A->>T: Transform Markdown → RDF
    T->>S: SPARQL UPDATE
    S-->>T: Confirmation
    T-->>A: RDF Representation
    A-->>O: Graph Sync Data
    O-->>R: Visual Graph Update
```

The Obsidian vault structure maps to CIDOC CRM entities via YAML frontmatter properties:

```yaml
---
crm_class: E31_Document
crm_id: "https://example.org/document/123"
p4_time_span: "1568-1574"
p16_used_specific_object: ["https://example.org/archive/letter_45"]
interpretation_assertions:
  - property: "P2_has_type"
    value: "eyewitness_account"
    assigned_by: "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097"
    evidence: "https://example.org/archive/correspondence_12"
    confidence: "high"
---
```

### 3.7 Visualization Layer

The visualization architecture supports dual-mode exploration:

| Mode | Technology | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2D Force-Directed Graph** | Cytoscape.js | Hypothesis verification, relationship tracing, source network analysis |
| **3D Semantic Galaxy** | LYNX Framework | Exploratory discovery, conceptual clustering, serendipitous connection identification |

LYNX demonstrates 60 FPS performance with 10,000+ node datasets and sub-200ms search latency, suitable for large-scale historical knowledge graphs.

## 4. Collaborative Infrastructure

### 4.1 Editorial Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Create Assertion
    Draft --> UnderReview: Submit for Peer Review
    UnderReview --> Approved: Consensus Reached
    UnderReview --> Contested: Disagreement Identified
    Contested --> AlternativeBranch: Create Interpretation Branch
    AlternativeBranch --> UnderReview: Submit Alternative
    Approved --> Published: Add to Main Branch
    Published --> [*]
    AlternativeBranch --> Published: Merge if Complementary
```

### 4.2 Peer Review Model

Unlike consensus-convergent models typical in scientific knowledge graphs, the historical research infrastructure accommodates persistent interpretive pluralism. The review process evaluates:

- **Evidentiary basis**: Completeness and relevance of cited sources
- **Logical coherence**: Internal consistency of the interpretive argument
- **Transparency**: Clarity of provenance and methodological assumptions
- **Relationship to existing interpretations**: Explicit characterization using CiTO vocabulary

Both approved and contested interpretations remain accessible, with the latter preserved in separate Git branches or as parallel `E13 Attribute Assignment` instances.

### 4.3 Community Governance Structure

The governance model draws from established open knowledge platforms:

| Component | Reference Model | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Editorial Access** | FactGrid | Registered researcher accounts; all edits versioned and attributable |
| **Quality Assurance** | DDE KG Editor | Community peer review with contribution records |
| **Policy Development** | Wikibase Stakeholder Group | Domain-specific steering committee |
| **Federated Data Sharing** | Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space | Staged publication from private to public data spaces |

### 4.4 Collaborative Features

- **Real-time presence indicators**: WebSocket notifications of concurrent editors
- **Inline discussion threads**: Annotation linked to specific RDF statements
- **Change proposals**: Merge request workflow for substantial revisions
- **Contribution metrics**: Public record of editorial activity for academic recognition

## 5. Sustainability Framework

### 5.1 Open Licensing Policy

| Data Category | License | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Knowledge Graph Metadata | CC0 1.0 | Maximize interoperability and reuse |
| Primary Source Transcriptions | CC BY-SA 4.0 | Preserve attribution while enabling derivative works |
| Scholarly Interpretations | CC BY 4.0 | Require attribution for academic credit |
| Software Components | MIT / Apache 2.0 | Open source development model |

The CC0 metadata policy aligns with Europeana and FactGrid precedents, while acknowledging that academic citation norms operate as a parallel social contract independent of legal obligation.

### 5.2 Institutional Hosting Model

The sustainability strategy follows the "embedded infrastructure" pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Financial Sustainability"
        F1[Research Grants<br>Initial Development]
        F2[NFDI / National Infrastructure<br>Ongoing Operations]
        F3[University Hosting<br>Perpetual Commitment]
    end

    subgraph "Technical Sustainability"
        T1[Open Source Stack<br>Community Maintenance]
        T2[Standard Ontologies<br>Long-term Compatibility]
        T3[Static Export Pipeline<br>Preservation Format]
    end

    subgraph "Community Sustainability"
        C1[Academic Recognition<br>Contribution Incentives]
        C2[Training & Documentation<br>Onboarding Pipeline]
        C3[Federated Ecosystem<br>Distributed Responsibility]
    end

    F1 --> F2
    F2 --> F3
    T1 --> T2
    T2 --> T3
    C1 --> C2
    C2 --> C3
```

The FactGrid precedent demonstrates viability: operational costs covered by NFDI4Memory consortium funding with unlimited operational guarantee from the University of Erfurt.

### 5.3 Long-term Preservation Strategy

| Preservation Tier | Method | Access Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Service** | Live SPARQL endpoint with full collaborative features | Daily operations |
| **Static Archive** | Annual RDF dump and static site generation | Perpetual reference |
| **Institutional Repository** | Deposit in university digital preservation system | Guaranteed permanence |

The static export pipeline generates a browse-only version of the knowledge graph using Gatsby or Hugo with Cytoscape.js visualization, reducing long-term maintenance costs while preserving accessibility.

### 5.4 Funding Model Composition

| Funding Source | Phase | Proportion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Research Council Grants | Development (Years 1-3) | 60% |
| National Research Data Infrastructure | Operation (Years 3+) | 50% |
| Institutional Host Contribution | Ongoing | 30% |
| Community Membership Fees | Ongoing | 20% |
