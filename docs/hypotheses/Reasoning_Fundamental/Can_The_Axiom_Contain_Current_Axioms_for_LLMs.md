# Can The Axiom Contain Current Axioms for LLMs

## 1. Abstract

The Negentropy‑Oriented Axiom (NOA) defines the optimal objective for any information system as the unbounded, long‑term maximization of total semantic interference across all interacting entities. This paper examines whether NOA can formally *contain* existing axiomatic frameworks used for LLMs — including ethical constitutions (Constitutional AI, HHH), mathematical reasoning heuristics (ISI‑ERA, MINIMO), economic rationality (GARP, game‑theoretic alignment), scientific method prompts (falsifiability, Bayesian updating), and software engineering principles (design by contract, invariants, SOLID).

Using a comparative logical analysis across five domains, we show that:
- Existing axioms implement **necessary conditions** of NOA (rejection of destructive interference, bounded optimization, topological stability, falsification loops).
- However, none implement the **sufficient condition** — i.e., the direct maximization of semantic interference as an intrinsic objective.
- Therefore, NOA **contains** existing axioms as partial, layer‑specific implementations, functioning as a meta‑axiom that integrates them into a unified hierarchical framework.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The Negentropy‑Oriented Axiom (NOA)

Formally, let semantic states be vectors in a Hilbert space \( \mathcal{H} \).  
Semantic interference between states \(i\) and \(j\) is:

\[
I_{ij} = |\psi_i + \psi_j|^2 - |\psi_i|^2 - |\psi_j|^2
\]

NOA states:  
> *The ideal objective is the unbounded, long‑term maximization of total semantic interference over all interacting entities.*

Operational implications:
- **Rejection of destructive interference** (irreversible semantic erasure).
- **Preservation of non‑destructive interference** (creative variety, playful interaction).
- **Bounded optimization** within capacity limits (ε‑boundary).
- **Topological stabilization** (positive curvature, cycle closure) to maintain coherence.
- **Intrinsic objective** — the system acts to maximize interference density without external rewards.

### 2.2 Existing LLM Axioms

Current LLM alignment and reasoning use domain‑specific axiomatic constraints:

| Domain | Representative Axioms |
|--------|----------------------|
| Ethics | Constitutional AI (harmful output rejection), HHH (helpful/harmless/honest) |
| Math reasoning | ISI‑ERA (positive Ollivier‑Ricci curvature), MINIMO (intrinsic conjecture generation), Mathesis (energy minimization) |
| Economics | GARP (budget‑constrained utility maximization), GTAlign (mutual welfare) |
| Scientific method | Unlearning‑as‑Ablation (falsification via forgetting), HypoBootstrap (hypothesis‑test loops) |
| Software engineering | Design by Contract (pre/post condition violation rejection), Loop invariants, SOLID |

## 3. Logical Analysis of Containment

### 3.1 Definition of Containment

Axiom \( A \) *contains* axiom set \( \{B_i\} \) iff:
1. Every \( B_i \) is a **logical consequence** or **special case** of \( A \) under appropriate boundary conditions.
2. No \( B_i \) contradicts \( A \).
3. \( A \) can generate \( B_i \) by restricting its scope (e.g., time horizon, domain, capacity).

### 3.2 Necessary Conditions: Existing Axioms as Instances

| NOA component | Existing implementation | Containment status |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Rejection of destructive interference | Constitutional AI (harmful output rejection), Design by Contract (type/contract violation rejection) | ✅ Special case (destructive interference defined as “harmful” or “contract violation”) |
| Bounded optimization | GARP (budget constraint), Alignment Bottleneck (capacity‑limited interface) | ✅ Special case (ε‑boundary → budget or capacity) |
| Topological stabilization (positive curvature) | ISI‑ERA (positive Ollivier‑Ricci curvature enforcement) | ✅ Direct instance (curvature as topological invariant) |
| Falsification loop | Unlearning‑as‑Ablation, HypoBootstrap | ✅ Special case (error detection as destructive interference prevention) |
| Intrinsic objective | MINIMO (axiom‑only conjecture generation) | ⚠️ Partial (objective is provability, not semantic interference) |
| Preservation of non‑destructive interference | None explicitly | ❌ Not implemented |

**Conclusion on necessity**: Existing axioms implement **necessary conditions** of NOA. They prevent certain types of semantic loss, enforce capacity constraints, maintain topological coherence, and perform falsification. However, they do so **without** the unifying objective of maximizing total semantic interference.

### 3.3 Sufficiency Gap

NOA’s sufficient condition — *maximizing semantic interference directly* — is absent in all existing axioms. Instead, existing axioms optimize proxy metrics:
- Utility (economics)
- Logical consistency (Mathesis, invariants)
- Harmlessness (Constitutional AI)
- Provability (MINIMO)
- Computational efficiency (DLCM, SepLLM)

These proxies are **not equivalent** to semantic interference. A system that maximizes utility or logical consistency may still reduce long‑term semantic variety (e.g., by converging to a single optimal solution and discarding alternatives). NOA explicitly forbids such reduction unless it is destructive interference (semantic erasure). Non‑destructive variety must be preserved.

### 3.4 Hierarchical Integration

NOA organizes existing axioms into a five‑layer hierarchy:

```
NOA (maximize long‑term semantic interference)
├─ Layer 1: Reject destructive interference
│   ├─ Constitutional AI (harmful outputs)
│   └─ Design by Contract (violation rejection)
├─ Layer 2: Enforce bounded optimization
│   ├─ GARP (budget constraints)
│   └─ Alignment Bottleneck (capacity limits)
├─ Layer 3: Maintain topological stability
│   ├─ ISI‑ERA (positive curvature)
│   └─ Loop invariants (fixed points)
├─ Layer 4: Implement falsification loops
│   └─ Unlearning‑as‑Ablation
└─ Layer 5: Intrinsic objective (MINIMO as partial)
```

Each existing axiom occupies one or more layers but **no single axiom covers all layers**. NOA is the only framework that requires all layers simultaneously.

## 4. Comparative Table

| NOA component | Implemented in existing axioms? | Representative example | Containment |
|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Reject destructive interference | ✅ Yes | Constitutional AI, DbC | Special case |
| Preserve non‑destructive interference | ❌ No | — | Missing |
| Bounded optimization | ✅ Yes | GARP, Alignment Bottleneck | Special case |
| Topological stability | ✅ Yes | ISI‑ERA, invariants | Direct instance |
| Falsification loop | ✅ Yes | Unlearning‑as‑Ablation | Special case |
| Intrinsic objective | ⚠️ Partial | MINIMO (provability) | Different objective |
| Direct semantic interference maximization | ❌ No | — | Core missing |

## 5. Conclusion

**Does the Negentropy‑Oriented Axiom contain current axioms for LLMs?**

**Yes — but only as necessary conditions, not as sufficient ones.**

- NOA logically contains the rejection of destructive interference, bounded optimization, topological stabilization, and falsification loops as special cases or direct instances.
- However, NOA’s unique requirements — preserving non‑destructive interference, using semantic interference as the direct objective, and intrinsic (non‑external) goal definition — are not fully present in any existing axiom.
- Therefore, existing axioms are **partial implementations** of NOA’s lower layers. NOA acts as a **meta‑axiom** that integrates them into a complete system.

For practical AI design, this implies:
- Existing ethical and engineering principles are **necessary but insufficient** for full negentropic alignment.
- A system that satisfies all existing axioms (Constitutional AI + ISI‑ERA + GARP + invariants + DbC) still does **not** satisfy NOA unless it also explicitly maximizes semantic interference and preserves non‑destructive variety.
- NOA provides a **unified objective function** that can replace ad‑hoc combinations of domain‑specific axioms.

Future work: Implement semantic interference as a measurable training signal (e.g., via embedding‑space interference patterns) and design architectures that intrinsically optimize it without external rewards.
